## âœ… Anchor-Script Protocol (v4) â€” 11 July 2025

### ðŸ§± Slide-Planning Reality

I. **Anchor-script *is* the teacherâ€™s slides**

* Not a separate outline â€” it *is* the actual lesson plan
* Whatâ€™s written = whatâ€™s shown = whatâ€™s said
* Teacher speaks freely but follows the exact anchor-script sequence and facts

II. **One section = one slide = one concept**

* No nesting
* Deep sub-concepts = separate slides or separate decks

III. **Anchor-script is the only source of truth**

* If visuals and voice disagree: **fix the deck, not the script**

---

### ðŸ§  Workflow Control

I. **Anchor-script is the only human-authored step**

* All downstream files are generated from it
* This includes:

  * Slide deck (`deck-v1`)
  * Narration (teacher recording)
  * Slide timing metadata
  * Image references

II. **Anchor-script is written in `.md` format**

* Clear
* Editable
* Durable
* Easier to version and annotate (icons, notes, tones, etc.)

---

### ðŸ§  Meta Object Clarification

* The term `meta` refers to a **runtime object**

* It is **not a saved file**, not part of deck structure

* It may be **generated on the fly** and contains:

  * Each slideâ€™s `start` and `end`
  * Each itemâ€™s `showAt` time
  * Any images used (URLs only)

* Eventually, this data is **merged into the slide JSON** before playback

---

### âœ… Final Summary

The **anchor-script is the only handcrafted element** in your system.
All other elements â€” visual, audio, temporal â€” are derived from it.

Deck production officially begins **only after anchor-script is finalized**.

Would you now like:

I. A blank `.md` anchor-script template to begin
II. To start writing Chapter 1â€™s anchor-script right now
III. Or something else?

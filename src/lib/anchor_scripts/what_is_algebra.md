Section: Introduction 🎞️ titleSlide 🎭 Tone: 💡 Conceptual ⏱️ EndTime: ___ 🧩

Let’s begin with a simple question — **what is Algebra, really?**  
We’re starting a new kind of math — one that uses **symbols** instead of just numbers.

Section: Origin of the Word 🎞️ imageLeftBulletsRight 🎭 Tone: 🧠 ⏱️ EndTime: ___ 🧩

The word **Algebra** comes from Arabic — **“al-jabr”** — meaning “reunion of broken parts”.  
It originally referred to fixing things, especially bones or broken equations.  
That same idea applies here: putting things together mathematically.

Section: Why Algebra? 🎞️ bulletList 🎭 Tone: 🎯 Definition ⏱️ EndTime: ___ 🧩

Why Algebra?  
Because arithmetic works with the **known**, Algebra works with the **unknown**.  
With Algebra, we write general **rules** like:

- total cost = price × quantity  
- area = length × width  

We can find **missing values**, not just compute.

So what kinds of problems does Algebra solve?  
Let’s look at three powerful examples — these define why Algebra matters.

Section: Problem Type 1 — Solving Unknowns 🎞️ twoColumnText 🎭 Tone: 💡 Core Use ⏱️ EndTime: ___ 🧩

“I think of a number. I add 3. The result is 7. What was the number?”  
This is Algebra’s foundation — **finding missing parts** using simple rules.  
It replaces guessing with method.

Section: Problem Type 2 — Writing Rules 🎞️ twoColumnText 🎭 Tone: 💡 Generalization ⏱️ EndTime: ___ 🧩

Algebra builds formulas that work again and again:

- Area = length × width  
- Speed = distance / time  
- Total = rate × time

These are **machines** in math — repeatable, logical, powerful.

Section: Problem Type 3 — Describing Patterns 🎞️ imageWithCaption 🎭 Tone: 💡 Pattern Insight ⏱️ EndTime: ___ 🧩

**The Pythagorean Theorem** says:  
> In any right triangle: `a² + b² = c²`  
No matter the triangle’s size — the rule **always works**.  
Algebra lets us describe deep patterns like this that go far beyond arithmetic.

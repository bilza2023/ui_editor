i have an educational app that is determined to make online education cheap

for this  i have decided to use  slides. so i have text based slides that are taken care by html elements 
and i have image based slides for which i have my own small draw engine in .js which write to canvas. i have my own assets etc as well. 


however i want to offload the maintainance of this engine as well. 

Question is there some other very very light library --a simple draw engine that i can plug in instead of my daw-engine??? 

Question 2: if i replace canvas with imaages how much of weight will it add. now i have just .js code and 2-3 images / presentation but then the entire slide = 1 image.

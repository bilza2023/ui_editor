  <h1>Rapid Application Development (RAD)</h1>

  <p>
    <span class="blue">Rapid Application Development (RAD)</span> is a method to build business systems without traditional software development.
    Instead, it uses powerful, ready-made tools like <span class="green">Notion</span>, <span class="green">Zapier</span>, <span class="green">Airtable</span>, and others to deliver a working solution fast — sometimes in hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach is perfect when you want to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>🚀 <span class="orange">Quickly test a business idea</span> without heavy investment</li>
    <li>🛠 <span class="orange">Build a "working demo"</span> before committing to full software</li>
    <li>📊 <span class="orange">Automate daily tasks</span> like client follow-ups, emails, form handling</li>
    <li>💡 <span class="orange">Convert business workflows</span> into digital processes with drag-and-drop simplicity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How a Small Business Becomes a System (With Notion)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>📁 <span class="pink">Track Inventory:</span> Create product tables, filter by stock, track vendors.</li>
    <li>📅 <span class="pink">Client Scheduling:</span> Add timelines, projects, and follow-up reminders.</li>
    <li>📨 <span class="pink">Lead Management:</span> Capture leads from forms and move them through pipelines.</li>
    <li>⚙️ <span class="pink">Automation with Zapier:</span> Auto-send emails, create tasks, or update Google Sheets in response to triggers.</li>
    <li>📲 <span class="pink">Build It in a Day:</span> A working system with data, forms, and automation — no coding!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span class="red">RAD is ideal for small business owners, consultants, and startups</span> who need results now. Once the business proves itself, the same system can be rebuilt as full software.

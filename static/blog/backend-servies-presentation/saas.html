  <h1>What is SaaS?</h1>

  <p>
    Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based software delivery model where applications are accessed over the internet. 
    It eliminates the need for installation, hosting, or server maintenance by the customer.
  </p>

  <p>
    SaaS is profitable because it offers recurring income through subscriptions, low per-client maintenance, and massive scalability.
    With one codebase and infrastructure, the service can support thousands of clients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providers can manage upgrades, security, and features centrally, reducing deployment costs and improving consistency across the board.
  </p>

  <h2 class="blue">Taleem.help as a SaaS Example</h2>
  <p>
    Taleem.help offers its education platform as a SaaS product. Our key modules include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Editor</li>
    <li>Player</li>
    <li>Syllabus Page</li>
    <li>Monogram / Branding</li>
    <li>Domain & Deployment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="blue">ðŸ”¹ Fully Isolated Deployments</h2>
  <p>
    When we partner with another school or institute, we do not offer shared access to our main Taleem.help system. 
    Instead, we set up their service as a standalone deployment on a separate server with isolated infrastructure.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Their own backend and frontend</li>
    <li>Independent database</li>
    <li>No shared admin or content access</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="orange">ðŸ”¹ Custom Domain & Branding</h2>
  <p>
    Each client receives their own domain and custom branding.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom domain like <code>learn.schoolabc.edu.pk</code></li>
    <li>Unique logo, color theme, and monogram</li>
    <li>Fully customized interface and printable reports</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="green">ðŸ”¹ Same Core Modules, Different Identity</h2>
  <p>
    The software logic stays the same, but each deployment appears fully personalized to that institution.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Re-uses Editor, Player, Syllabus Page</li>
    <li>Each instance has its own look and branding</li>
    <li>Faster rollout, full uniqueness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="red">ðŸ”¹ Maintained by Taleem.help</h2>
  <p>
    All technical management stays with us. The client gets a private cloud app with full support.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We handle hosting, updates, and backups</li>
    <li>Client pays a fixed setup + monthly support</li>
    <li>Peace of mind with zero infrastructure hassle</li>
  </ul>

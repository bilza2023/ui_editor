  <h1>Development Rules – Taleem.help</h1>

  <div class="point point1">
    <div class="point-title">1. Stay Out of Business Design</div>
    <p class="point-text">We build IT systems — not business models. Clients must define their business logic and goals; we handle the implementation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="point point2">
    <div class="point-title">2. No Unmetered Work</div>
    <p class="point-text">All tasks — including revisions — are formal projects with scope, timelines, and pricing. No open-ended or undocumented changes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="point point3">
    <div class="point-title">3. Sprint-Based Delivery</div>
    <p class="point-text">Work is delivered in short, clear sprints. Each sprint has defined goals, outcomes, and client feedback cycles.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="point point4">
    <div class="point-title">4. Consultancy is the Main Business</div>
    <p class="point-text">We don’t just code — we plan, audit, and guide. Our consultancy service includes architecture planning, team structuring, scaling advice, and long-term backend strategy for businesses and startups.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="point point5">
    <div class="point-title">5. Be Open to Custom Deals</div>
    <p class="point-text">We support flexible partnerships — for example, a client can sponsor a developer "seat," where we hire and manage a developer on their behalf to work full-time on their project, remotely or embedded.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="point point6">
    <div class="point-title">6. Avoid Feature Creep</div>
    <p class="point-text">Feature creep refers to the continuous addition of new features beyond the original scope, leading to project delays and increased complexity. To maintain focus and efficiency, we adhere strictly to the agreed-upon feature set and discourage mid-project additions without proper evaluation and approval.</p>
  </div>

  
  <div class="point point7">
    <div class="point-title">7. Testing and Documentation Are Mandatory</div>
    <p class="point-text">
      In professional software delivery, only about 1/3 of the time goes into writing code — the remaining 2/3 is spent on thorough testing and clear documentation. 
      This is what separates an agency from a freelancer. Testing ensures the product is stable, usable, and safe. 
      We do not allow clients to skip this step to reduce costs — because skipping tests means skipping quality.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="point point8">
    <div class="point-title">8. Documentation = Usability</div>
    <p class="point-text">
      A system without documentation is like a machine without a manual. 
      For every delivery, we provide documentation to explain how to use the system, where to find things, and how to scale or update it later. 
      This is why agencies charge more — we don't just deliver code, we deliver a complete, understandable product.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="point point9">
    <div class="point-title">9. Modular & Maintainable Code</div>
    <p class="point-text">
      All code we write is modular, clean, and built to be maintained by other developers in the future. 
      We follow best practices, naming conventions, and organized structure to ensure the project can grow easily — whether you stay with us or move to another team.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="point point10">
    <div class="point-title">10. Iron-Clad Contract / NDA</div>
    <p class="point-text">
      Every project must begin with a written contract that includes exact deliverables, timelines, payment milestones, and responsibilities. 
      What is not written should never be assumed. This protects both the client and the developers from misunderstandings and sets clear expectations.
    </p>

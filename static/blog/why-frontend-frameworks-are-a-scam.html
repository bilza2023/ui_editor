  <h1>🧨 Why Modern Frontend Frameworks Are a Scam</h1>
  <div class="text-xs">13 July 2025</div>
  <hr />

  <p>Everyone says: "Use React, use Svelte, use Vue — they're the future!" But the deeper you go, the more you realize...</p>

  <h2>🔍 The Core Problems</h2>

  <h3>1. You end up babysitting your state</h3>
  <p>Every developer eventually writes a function like <code>redraw()</code> that exists solely to poke the framework and force a UI update. Why? Because setting a nested property, modifying an array, or tweaking an object silently fails to trigger reactivity. You’re not managing state — you’re tricking the framework into thinking you did. It becomes a cycle of cloning, spreading, and reassigning — all to keep the illusion alive.</p>
  <p>Real reactivity should be automatic and consistent. If you're spending more time making the framework notice your changes than writing actual logic, then it's not helping — it's babysitting.</p>

  <h3>2. "Surgical DOM updates" — for what?</h3>
  <p>Frameworks boast that they surgically update the DOM using diffing algorithms, fiber trees, and shadow nodes. But most apps — especially educational ones — just show a few headers, paragraphs, and images. Why do we need a surgeon to rearrange a shopping list? The complexity is unnecessary. A simple innerHTML or template refresh would suffice.</p>
  <p>Optimizing for performance only matters when you're hitting performance bottlenecks. For most use cases, the DOM isn’t the problem — it’s the overengineering that is.</p>

  <h3>3. Web components? It’s called a webpage.</h3>
  <p>Framework evangelists praise web components for bundling HTML, JS, and CSS together. But the web already had that — it’s called a <code>.html</code> file. A webpage <em>is</em> the original component: self-contained, renderable, cacheable, and portable. No build step needed. No runtime needed. Just open and it works.</p>
  <p>You don’t need a shadow DOM to isolate styles. You need clarity and discipline — something a well-structured webpage offers natively.</p>

  <h3>4. Fragmented views, not cohesive apps</h3>
  <p>In frameworks like Svelte and React, the "app" is just a bundle of disconnected components. Each one is reactive in isolation, but there's no unifying backbone. You can’t easily reason about global state, cross-component flow, or app-level structure.</p>
  <p>You end up with dozens of mini-apps — each <code>.svelte</code> or <code>.jsx</code> file doing its own thing. The result isn’t an application. It’s a patchwork. A network of floating UI islands with no shared architecture.</p>

  <h3>5. Reactivity ≠ reactive</h3>
  <p>Frameworks claim to be reactive, but they fail on the most basic interactions. Set a property in an object? Doesn’t work. Update a specific index in an array? Nothing happens. Unless you know the exact magic dance — clone, spread, reassign — the view won't update.</p>
  <p>This isn’t reactivity. It’s a guessing game. You become a state mechanic, patching and poking your data instead of working with it directly.</p>

  <h3>6. One reactive statement = total rehydration trap</h3>
  <p>You use a simple reactive expression like <code>{$count}</code> and suddenly you're thrown into the world of SSR, hydration mismatches, lifecycle bugs, and race conditions. What started as a small template grows into a minefield of edge cases between server and client.</p>
  <p>Why are you even in this debate? You wanted a live counter. You got a hydration debugging session. That’s not productivity — it’s overhead in disguise.</p>

  <h3>7. In React/Svelte you invent structure. In Express, you inherit it.</h3>
  <p>Express gives you rails to follow: routers, controllers, services, views. It pushes you toward discipline — whether you like it or not. React and Svelte? They give you nothing. No file structure. No conventions. Just a blank slate and a lot of opinions to choose from.</p>
  <p>You spend your first days inventing patterns. Then weeks fixing what those patterns broke. A real framework should <em>reduce</em> uncertainty, not create it.</p>

  <h3>8. You build an app. Then spend 100 hours fighting the framework to make it feel like an app.</h3>
  <p>You start with enthusiasm. The first component looks great. But then you want routing, persistent state, modals, loading indicators, and shared logic. That’s when things break. You start gluing libraries together. Hacking the store. Passing props five levels deep.</p>
  <p>What you built isn’t an app — it’s a shell. The hard stuff remains unsolved, and the easy stuff was never the problem to begin with.</p>

  <hr />
  <h2>💡 Final Realization</h2>
  <p>You wanted a reactive interface. But instead of reactivity, you got fragility. The closer you got to shipping, the more the framework fought back. You stopped building features and started fixing abstractions.</p>
  <p>Reactivity was supposed to help you — not become your job title.</p>

  <h3>🧭 The Return to Earth</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Express + EJS</strong> → gives you real structure, with named files, testable logic, and full visibility</li>
    <li><strong>Plain JS</strong> → lets you build real behavior without magic</li>
    <li><strong>HTML</strong> → already is the perfect component: bundled, visible, portable</li>
    <li><strong>A loop</strong> → is all the reactivity you need. One heartbeat driving your system. Fully testable. Fully controlled.</li>
  </ul>

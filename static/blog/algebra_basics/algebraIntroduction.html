    <h2>Why Do We Need Algebra?</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you're told: "I‚Äôm thinking of a number. If I add 4 to it, I get 7. What‚Äôs the number?"  
      That question can‚Äôt be answered with arithmetic alone ‚Äî it needs <strong>algebra</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra helps us work with unknown values, express general patterns, and build formulas that solve real-world problems.

    <h2>Arithmetic vs Algebra</h2>
    <p>
      Arithmetic focuses on specific numbers and operations:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic:</strong> 3 + 4 = 7</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic:</strong> 10 √∑ 2 = 5</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra introduces <em>symbols</em> and <em>general rules</em>:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> x + 4 = 7 ‚Üí x = 3</li>
        <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> a √∑ 2 = 5 ‚Üí a = 10</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      While arithmetic answers ‚Äúwhat is,‚Äù algebra answers ‚Äúwhat could be.‚Äù

    <h2>Solving for the Unknown</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra allows us to represent problems using unknown values (like x or y) and then solve for them. 
      This is useful in countless situations:
      <ul>
        <li>Finding missing prices in budgets</li>
        <li>Working backward from total scores</li>
        <li>Figuring out original amounts after a discount</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In every case, the structure is the same:
      <br><code>known + unknown = result</code> ‚Üí solve for the unknown.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Algebra Shows Relationships</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra isn‚Äôt just about solving for a number ‚Äî it‚Äôs about showing how things are connected.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Distance = Speed √ó Time</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Area = Length √ó Width</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Total = Rate √ó Quantity</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These formulas describe relationships between quantities, and algebra allows us to work with them in any direction.
    </p>

    <h2>Algebra Makes Formulas Work</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra is what powers every formula. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>If <code>A = L √ó W</code> and you know A and W, you can find L: <code>L = A √∑ W</code></li>
        <li>If <code>v = d √∑ t</code> and you know d and t, you can solve for v</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These aren‚Äôt just tricks ‚Äî they‚Äôre algebra in action. The power to rearrange and solve any part of a formula comes from understanding algebra.

    <h2>Conclusion: The Power of Algebra</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra helps us ask better questions, solve unknowns, and think in terms of relationships ‚Äî not just numbers. 
      It is the language of science, logic, and structured thinking.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning algebra is like gaining a new tool that works in every field: math, physics, business, technology, and beyond.

  <h1>What is Algebra?</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and relationships between them. 
      It allows us to generalize arithmetic patterns, solve problems with unknown values, and describe mathematical relationships in a precise way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra is the foundation for nearly all of modern mathematics and science ‚Äî from equations in physics to algorithms in computer science.

    <h2>Definition of Algebra</h2>
    <p>
      Formally, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. 
      It deals with expressions, equations, formulas, and variables that represent numbers or quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of solving only specific problems like "3 + 4 = 7", algebra helps us solve general problems like "x + 4 = 7".
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>From Arithmetic to Algebra</h2>
    <p>
      Arithmetic is based on actual numbers. Algebra extends this by introducing variables ‚Äî symbols that stand for unknown or changing values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic: 3 + 4 = 7</li>
        <li>Algebra: x + 4 = 7 ‚Üí x = 3</li>
      </ul>
      This shift makes algebra far more powerful and general than arithmetic.
    </p>

    <h2>History and Origin</h2>
    <p>
      The word "Algebra" comes from the Arabic word <em>al-jabr</em>, meaning "reunion of broken parts". 
      It was popularized by the mathematician Al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century in his book <em>Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra has roots in ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Greece, but it became a formal mathematical system through Islamic scholars.

    <h2>Core Building Blocks of Algebra</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variable:</strong> A symbol (like x or y) that represents an unknown value</li>
      <li><strong>Constant:</strong> A fixed, known number (like 3 or ‚àí7)</li>
      <li><strong>Term:</strong> A number, a variable, or a product of both (e.g., 3x)</li>
      <li><strong>Expression:</strong> A combination of terms (e.g., 2x + 5)</li>
      <li><strong>Equation:</strong> A statement that two expressions are equal (e.g., 2x + 5 = 11)</li>
      <li><strong>Operator:</strong> Mathematical actions: +, ‚àí, √ó, √∑</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of Algebraic Statements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Expression:</strong> An algebraic phrase like 3x + 2 (no equals sign)</li>
      <li><strong>Equation:</strong> A statement like 3x + 2 = 11</li>
      <li><strong>Identity:</strong> A true equation for all values, like (a + b)¬≤ = a¬≤ + 2ab + b¬≤</li>
      <li><strong>Inequality:</strong> A comparison, such as x > 5 or x ‚â§ 2</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Everyday Examples of Algebra</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Solving for a missing price in a budget</li>
      <li>Calculating distance, speed, or time with formulas</li>
      <li>Analyzing data using graphs and trends</li>
      <li>Determining unknown angles in geometry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Algebra isn't just academic ‚Äî it's embedded in everything from construction to programming to financial planning.

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Algebra is only about solving x and y ‚Äî false. It's about understanding patterns and relationships.</li>
      <li>You can‚Äôt have variables in denominators ‚Äî false. It‚Äôs common in rational expressions.</li>
      <li>Algebra is only useful in math class ‚Äî false. It's used in science, business, and tech daily.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Algebra is Important</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra teaches logical thinking and structured problem-solving. It's essential for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Science and engineering formulas</li>
      <li>Computer programming and algorithms</li>
      <li>Economics and finance models</li>
      <li>Higher math like calculus, statistics, and linear algebra</li>
    </ul>
